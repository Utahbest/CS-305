# CS-305

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  - Artemis Monetary is an organization centered around currency wanting to increase the security of it's current application.

•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  
  - I used static testing to determine weaknesses in the app’s code. It’s critical to code safely since you have the responsibility of protecting the property of your client and yourself. The release of individual data and proprietary involvement could hurt the client significantly. As a coder, the code must be able to be long-lasting in order to protect the safeguarding of the client’s data for years to come.

•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  
  - I found that the reliance check device helped the most to identify weak points quickly instead of looking manually.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  
  - To add another layer of security I must refresh old libraries being used in the code to current updates to test for current weaknesses. Later I could use entrance testing to check for any additional errors in the code.

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  
  -  I troubleshoot throughout writing my code to clean up an application issue. After the code was refactored, I used another weakness test to clean up any additional weaknesses missed from the troubleshooting.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  
  - I mostly used stack flood and later asked around to see if others had relatable conditions specifically within the control center.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  
  - I found that showing my coded interchanges formulated by a hash capability would be a great way to promote myself to future businesses.
